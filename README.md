# Phase Space Propagator
 An optical propagation algorithm based on the properties of phase space. This code leverages the known free-space propagation law of the phase space density to produce a general means of propagating partially coherent wave fields. 

 Currently this propagator is best suited for 1D wave fields and separable 2D wave fields.

 Installation of the propagator is as follows:
 ```
    pip install your-package-name
 ```

 Please review the example files for a demonstration of its use.

 This code is also available at PyPi [here](https://pypi.org/project/psprop/)

 A fuller description of the theory is included in a journal publication to-be-submitted.
